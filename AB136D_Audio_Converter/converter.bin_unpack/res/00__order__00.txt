// NOTICE: You should not modify the order of the resource files below in any way.
// The firmware refers to each resource by the means of hardcoded offsets to the
// address and size fields of the entries themselve, meaning that if you change
// the order of the items (or insert something in between), you'll most likely just break it.
// This file solely exists to not alter the order of the entries in case the filesystem where
// these entries are being extracted to alters the order even further.
// Also, the entries that are zero bytes in length are also listed there,
// instead of being extracted like any other file.
